<!-- Sass Variables
====================

Variables are a way to store information that you can re-use later.

With Sass, you can store information in variables, like:

  > strings
  > numbers
  > colors
  > booleans
  > lists
  > nulls

Sass uses the '$' symbol, followed by a name, to declare variables:

Sass Variable Syntax:
--------------------
____________________
$variablename: value;

The following example declares 4 variables named myFont, myColor,
myFontSize, and myWidth. After the variables are declared, you can use
the variables wherever you want: -->




        <h1 id="h1-01">Hello World</h1>

        <p id="p-01">This is a paragraph.</p>

        <div id="div-01">This is some text inside a container.</div>


<!-- So, when the Sass file is transpiled, it takes the variables 
    (myFont, myColor, etc.) and outputs normal CSS with the variable 
    values placed in the CSS -->


<!-- Sass Variable Scope
=========================

Sass variables are only available at the level of nesting where they are defined.

Look at the following example: -->


        <h1 id="h1-02">Hello World</h1>

        <p id="p-02">This is a paragraph.</p>

        <div id="div-02">This is some text inside a container.</div>


<!-- Using Sass !global
    ====================

The default behavior for variable scope can be overridden by using 
the '!global' switch.

'!global' indicates that a variable is global, which means that it is 
accessible on all levels.

Look at the following example: same as above, but with '!global' added -->

        <h1 id="h1-03">Hello World</h1>

        <p id="p-03">This is a paragraph.</p>

        <div id="div-03">This is some text inside a container.</div>


<!-- IMPORTANT Tip: Global variables should be defined outside any rules. 
                    It could be wise to define all global variables in its 
                    own file, named "_globals.scss", and include the file 
                    with the @include keyword. -->
