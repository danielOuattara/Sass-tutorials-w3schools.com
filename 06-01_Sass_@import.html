<!-- Sass keeps the CSS code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). 
    
One way to write DRY code file is to keep related code section in separate files.

You can create small files with CSS snippets to include in other Sass files. 

Examples of such files can be: reset file, variables, colors, fonts, font-sizes, etc. -->
 
 
<!-- Sass Importing Files
==========================

Just like CSS, Sass also supports the '@import' directive.

The '@import' directive allows you to include the content of one file in another.

The CSS '@import' directive has a major drawback due to performance issues; 
it creates an extra HTTP request each time you call it.

However, the Sass '@import' directive includes the file in the CSS; 
so no extra HTTP call is required at runtime! 

Sass Import Syntax:  @import filename;
-------------------

Tip:  > You do not need to specify a file extension, Sass automatically assumes that you 
        mean a '.sass' or '.scss' file. 
      
      > You can also import CSS files. The '@import' directive imports the file and any 
        'variables' or 'mixins' defined in the imported file can then be used in the main file.

You can import as many files as you need in the main file:

Example:
---------

@import "variables";
@import "colors";
@import "reset";

Let's look at an example: Let's assume we have a reset file called "reset.scss", 
that looks like this:
-------------------------
html,
body,
ul,
ol {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
--------------------------

We write some code in 06_Sass_@import.scss (open to see)
-->

    <ul>
        <ol>one</ol>
        <ol>two</ol>
        <ol>three</ol>
    </ul>

<!-- and now we want to import the "06_@import.scss" file into another file called 
    "06_Sass_@import_Other-1.scss".

Here is how we do it: add @import "06_Sass_@import" to the top of the targeted file.

It is normal to add the @import directive at the top of the targeted file; 
this way its content will have a global scope: -->


<!-- Sass Partials
    =================

By default, Sass transpiles all the .scss files directly. However, when you want
to import a file, you do not need the file to be transpiled directly.

Sass has a mechanism for this: If you start the filename with an underscore, Sass 
will not transpile it. Files named this way are called partials in Sass.



Sass Partial Syntax:    _filename;
-------------------

The following example shows a partial Sass file named "_colors.scss". 
(This file will not be transpiled directly to "colors.css"):

Example:
--------

"_colors.scss":

$myPink: #EE82EE;
$myBlue: #4169E1;
$myGreen: #8FBC8F;


Now, if you import the partial file, omit the underscore. Sass understands that 
it should import the file "_colors.scss":

Example:
--------
@import "colors";

body {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 18px;
  color: $myBlue;
}
