What You Should Already Know
==============================
Before you continue you should have a basic understanding
of the following:
    > HTML
    > CSS

What is Sass?
==============

     Sass ...

    >  stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
    >  is an extension to CSS
    >  is a CSS pre-processor
    >  is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
    >  reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time
    >  was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006
    >  is free to download and use


Why Use Sass?
=============

Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain.
This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.

Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested
rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.


A Simple Example why Sass is Useful
===================================

Let's say we have a website with three main colors:
#a2b9bc  #b2ad7f  #878f99

So, how many times do you need to type those HEX values? A LOT of times.
And what about variations of the same colors?

Instead of typing the above values a lot of times, you can use Sass and write
this: -->


<!--      
          define variables for the primary colors:
          $primary_1: #a2b9bc;
          $primary_2: #b2ad7f;
          $primary_3: #878f99;

          /* Use the variables:*/
          .main-header {
            background-color: $primary_1;
          }
          .menu-left {
            background-color: $primary_2;
          }
          .menu-right {
            background-color: $primary_3;
          }
        -->


<!-- So, when using Sass, and the primary color changes, you only need to
change it in one place.


How Does Sass Work ?
====================

A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass
pre-processor to convert Sass code into standard CSS.

This process is called 'transpiling'. So, you need to give a transpiler
(some kind of program) some Sass code and then get some CSS code back.

Tip:  Transpiling is a term for taking a source code written in one language and
----  transform/translate it into another language.


Sass File Type
==============

Sass files has the ".scss" file extension.


Sass Comments
=============

Sass supports standard CSS comments:
 /* comment */
 
 In addition it supports inline comments 
 // comment                                                                   -->
